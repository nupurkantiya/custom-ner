After training the model has to \nlearn to predict the future sales  \nImage classification  \nIn this project we have to train the ML model to learn to classify images based on the given unlabelled \ndata. We have to separate the image for test and train se t. In this model it has to learn to Classify on \nit’s own. We have use OPENCV2 , CNN and Tensorflow and Keras. After the model Development \nwe train it using the train data set . We do the cross validation and calculate the accuracy score.  ",

Since we had 6 labels to be predicted we \nintroduced a new column ‘label’ which shows ‘1’ for good/neutral comments and ‘0’ for negative \ncomments   \n• We have used Vectorizer to convert comment tokens to numeric form.   \n• After considering the mentioned algorithms we concluded Decision Tree Model to be best model \nwhich gave an accuracy of 95.2%.  \nDomain:  Rating Prediction Project   \nTech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook,   \n• Objective: Build a Classification model to predict the Ratings.  \n• Solution: performed data visualization using Matplotlib on different views, performed EDA, \nstandard scaling to make data ready for multiple Classification models.  \n• Key Achievement: Successful results with Random Forest classifier model.
